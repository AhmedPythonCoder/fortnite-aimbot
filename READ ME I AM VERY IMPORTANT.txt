How to run the Aimbot:

[1] Locate the AIMBOT.exe file
[2] Run the AIMBOT.exe file
[3] If nothing pops up on the screen, then the script has been successfully injected!
[4] Please run the AIMBOT.exe file before launching the game, or the game will automatically detect it and it will not work!

If the aimbot does not work, then you need to wait 1 hour before running again. In the meantime, please keep your machine on. If you turn off your machine, then you will need to rerun the script and wait the hour.
